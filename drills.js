/*1. What is the Big O for this?

1) O(1) because if you yell out to a crowd someone 
can answer regardless of crowd size. Didn't need to
go through and ask people individually 

2) Linear time O(n) since run time is directly proportional
to number of people to ask. Asking two people will take
twice as long as asking one person and there's no random direction

*/

/* 
2. Even or odd

Linear

3. Are you here?
Polynomial time because it requires to levels of looping

4. Doubler
Linear time because you have to go through every value to execute

5. Naive search
Linear time because you have to go through every value to execute

6. Creating Pairs
Polynomial time because it requires to levels of looping

7. Compute the sequence
Fibonnaci sequence? Linear time complexity

8. An efficient search
